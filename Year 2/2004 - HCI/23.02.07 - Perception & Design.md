>*Perception is the cognitive process by which sensations are organised into an inner representation of the world*
- Detection -> Is stimulus present?
- Identification -> What is the stimulus?
- Categorisation -> What kind of stimulus is it?

## Design Considerations
- How do people read from a screen?
	- Scanning
	- implications for layout and structure

- Sensory Limitations:
	- visual acuity
	- Contrast sensitivity
	- colour discrimination
- Implications for text/graphic: size, style, colour, backgrounds
