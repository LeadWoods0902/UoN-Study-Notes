## Types of Control
#### Discrete
- Activation (ie clicking a button)
- Data entry (ie entering either a letter or a number)
- Setting (ie Selecting a specific state)

#### Continuous
- Quantitative Setting (ie turning a radio control)
- Continuous Control ()

## Important Factors
- Feedback
	- Inform the user that the action has had an effect.
		- Sound
		- Visual
		- Feel
			- Tactile
			- Rumble
			- Temperature

- Control Resistance
	- Valuable in continuous controls
	- Prevents accidental activation/ modification
	- Must consider physical capacities
		- fatigue
		- RSI
		- injury

- Size
	- Surface area of control
	- Consider the action required to interact
		- foot pedal will be larger than thumb-stick

- Weight
- Texture
	- Grip
- Coding
	- Colour
	- Sound
	- Shape
	- Size
	- Texture
	- Temperature
