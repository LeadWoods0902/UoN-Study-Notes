## Quality in Use

- Functionality
- Reliability
- Usability
- Efficiency
- Maintainability
- Portability

## What is Usability?

Usability depends on:
- Who the user are
- The environment in which they will interact
	- social
	- organisational
	- physical
- The goals they intend to achieve

## Measuring Usability

Effectiveness = achievement of goals
Efficiency = Resources utilised in achieving goals
Satisfaction = comfort, acceptability

#### Effectiveness

*The extent to which a userâ€™s goal, or task is achieved*

Ratio of successes to failures

#### Efficiency

*The amount of effort required to accomplish a goal*

Assessed by examining: Time spent, Workload, Deviations from critical path, Error rates.

#### Satisfaction

*The comfort and acceptability of use*

Assessed by measuring:
- Subjective ratings of 'ease of use'
- ratings of utility of functionality
- likes and dislikes

## usability heuristics

- guess-ability
- learnability
- Experienced user potential
- System potential
- Re-usability
- Efficiency
- Errors
- Satisfaction
- Memorability (re-usability)

## Principles of transforming a difficult task into a simple one

1. Use both knowledge in the world and knowledge in the head
2. Simplify the structure of the task
3. Make things visible. Bridge the gulfs of execution and Evaluation
4. Get the mappings right
5. Exploit the power of constraints both natural and artificial
6. Design for error
7. When all else fails, standardise
