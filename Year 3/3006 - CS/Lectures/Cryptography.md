## Summary
- What is cryptography?
- Symmetric Encryption
	- Stream and block ciphers
- Asymmetric Encryption
- Key Exchange


## Symmetric Cryptography
Encryption provides *confidentiality*
Symmetric encryption equivalent to a padlock
- Same key to *encrypt* and *decrypt*

Used for general communication
*lightweight* and *fast*
- Streaming, disk encryption, browsing etc

Key management **difficult**
- For a network of n users: n(n+1)/2 keys

Implemented using *block* or *stream* ciphers
no "proof" of security
- But based on *established principles*
- Not broken after many years and tremendous scrutiny

#### Stream Ciphers
Stream Ciphers use an initial *seed* key to generate an *infinite keystream* of random looking bits.

Message and keystream combined with XOR (typically), which reverses if applied twice

| A | B | A xor B | (A xor B) xor B |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |

$\therefore A = (A\oplus B) \oplus B$

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :--: | :--: |
| Encrypts long continuous streams, possibly of unknown length | The keystream must appear statistically random |
| Extremely fast with a low memory footprint, ideal for low-power devices | Steam ciphers do not protect the ciphertext |
| If designed well, can seek to any location in the stream |  |

#### Block Ciphers
Block Ciphers use a key to encrypt a *fixed-size block* of plaintext into a *fixed-size block* of ciphertext.
- Changing and permuting bits of the block depending on the key

Different lengths of message can be handled by *splitting* the message up, and padding
- Modes: CTR, OFB, GCM

###### CTR
###### OFB
###### GCM

#### Key Mixing
Mixing in the key prevents attackers from reversing the process

#### Symmetric algorithms
DES was used from '70 to to 2000
3DES still used in some legacy systems
- DES x3
AES and ChaCha20 are the only ciphers used in TLS 1.3

| Algorithm | Type | Design | Block Size (bits) | Speed | Memory Footprint | Difficulty | Key Size (bits) |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| DES | Block | Feistel | 64 | Fast | Low | Easy | 56 |
| 3DES | Block | Feistel | 64 | Slow | Low | Easy | 112 |
| AES | Block | SP-Network | 128 | Very Fast | Low-Medium | Hard | 128/192/256 |
| ChaCha20 | Stream | add-xor-rot | N/A | Very Fast | Very Low |  Easy | 256 |

#### Cryptographic Attack Models

#### Key Sizes
Symmetric encryption is only susceptible to *brute force*
128 bit keys means 2^128 possible solutions
256 is not "twice as difficult" 
- 2^128 = 3.4028237e+38
- 2^256 = 1.1579209e+77
- 128x more possible solutions

Global computational power between 2^80 and 2^90
- No concern for easy brute forcing


## Asymmetric Cryptography

#### Public-Key Cryptography
Asymmetric encryption equivalent to a mailbox
- two keys:
	- Private
	- Public

Uses *key Exchange* and *signatures*
- **Expensive**
- Key management is **easier**
	- n keys for n users

Public-key (asymmetric) cryptography hinges upon the premise that:
- *"It is computationally infeasible to calculate a private from a public key"*

#### Diffie-Hellman Key Exchanges
Allow two parties to mathematically agree on a shared secret over an insecure channel

#### Digital Signatures
The authentication of signatures generated by the **private key** can be verified by the *public key*

#### Public Key Algorithms
| Algorithm | Key Exchange | Encryption | Digital Signatures | Mathematical Problem | Elliptic Curves | Key Size (bits) |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Diffie-Hellman | $\checkmark$ |  |  | Discrete Logs | $\checkmark$ | 256 |
| RSA |  | $\checkmark$ | $\checkmark$ | Integer Factorisation |  | 2048/4096 |
| Elgamal |  | $\checkmark$ | $\checkmark$ | Discrete Logs | $\checkmark$ | 2048 |
| DSA |  |  | $\checkmark$ | Discrete Logs | $\checkmark$ | 256 |

## Protocols
TLS is a handshake and record protocol that provides end-to-end encryption.
- used in HTTPS
- provides:
	- Confidentiality
	- Integrity
	- Server Authenticity
