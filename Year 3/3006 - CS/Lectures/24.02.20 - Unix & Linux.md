## Role of the OS
Compactly combine:
- Identification
- Authentication
- Access Control
- Auditing

Has user accounts to handle permissions

software installation and configuration

---
## After Authentication
Authentication lets us verify who we are to a system.
Assuming we've authenticated:
- some files are private, some are public
- System files should be protected
- We need to be able t o access some applications
We need a mechanism to enforce *access control*

---
## Authentication & Authorisation
In Linux, everything is a file

Subject / Principal -> an active entity
Object -> resource being accessed
Access Operation
Reference monitor -> grants or denies access

## Principals & Subjects

**Principal:**
"An entity that can be granted access to objects or can make statements affecting access control decisions"
- eg user identity in an OS
- Used when discussing security policies

**Subject:**
"An active entity within an IT/ System"
- eg process running under a user identity
- Used when discussing operational systems enforcing policies

---
## Objects
File or Resource, eg memory, printers, directories

**Two options for focusing control:**
- What a subject is allowed to do
- What may be done to an object

---
## General Model

**Common file access:**
- Read - Simple viewing (**Confidentiality**)
- Write - changing, appending, deleting (**Integrity**)
- Execute - run a file without knowing its contents (**Security**)

---
## Groups
Users with similar access rights can be collected into groups
Groups are given permissions to access objects

## Linux Architecture

![[Pasted image 20240425173440.png]]

---
## UID/ GID
usernames in Unix/ Linux are soft aliases, your UID is what determines permissions
- user identities: UID
- group identities: GID
your IDs are stored in /etc/passwd
Root's UID is 0

---
## /etc/passwd
stores user accounts, not just password

*username : password : UID : GID : ID_string : home_dir : login_shell*
*sec : x : 1000 : 1001 : Dr. S Security : /home/sec : /bin/bash*
*root : x : 0 : 0 : root : /root : /bin/bash*

---
## The Shadow File
password hashes stored in a separate file, readable by root only

/etc/shadow stores the hashes needed to authenticate users

---
## Root
The all powerful Unix super-user

Login

Audio

I/O

Limits:
- Read only Filesystem
- Decrypt hashed passwords

---
## Permissions
Every resource has permission bits - held in the inode metadata
permissions for user/group/others

**Octal Representation**

## Directories

Directory permissions are slightly different:
r - list all files within the directory
w - add or remove files
x - traverse directory, open files in the directory
