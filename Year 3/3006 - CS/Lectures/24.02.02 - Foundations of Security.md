- The Layer Below


---
## General Security
Security = Protection of Assets (Assets meaning anything you want protecting)

Protection Measures
- Prevention
- Detection
- Recovery (manual &/or automatic)


---
## Defining Security
Does secure mean "unbreakable" or "secure *enough*"

Secure enough -> as often simply an arms race between defenders and malicious users

### Trade offs & Risk analysis
*TBDL*
### Cost / Benefit
*TBDL*

---
## Managing Security
Management team responsible for defining security needs

Developers implement the policies

---
## Computer Security
Three Key Areas: CIA

### Confidentiality
Prevention of unauthorised **disclosure** of information
#### Privacy
The protection of personal data
Consumer has a right to privacy

#### Examples:
- medical records
- Transfer of credit card details

### Integrity
Prevention of unauthorised *modification* of information
#### Examples:
- Distributed bank transactions
- Database records
### Availability
prevention of unauthorised *withholding* of information or resources
#### Prevention of Denial of Service attacks

#### Examples:
- redundant power supplies
- firewall packet filtering
- backups

## Integrity vs Authenticity
#### Can we verify the sender?
- do we know that the request we received is the request sent by the sender?

#### Does it have freshness?
- is the request recent?
- Typically requests time out in modern systems

Authenticity = Integrity + Freshness


---
## Accountability
Users should be held responsible for their actions

The system should ***identify*** and ***authenticate*** users

Audit trails ***must*** be kept

---
## Non-Repudiation
- provides un-forgeable evidence that someone did something
- mostly a legal concept
- Evidence verifiable by a trusted third third party
	- Notaries, Digital Certificates
- Applies to physical security
	- keycards, biometrics

---
## A fundamental Dilemma
*"Security-unaware users have specific security requirements but no security expertise"*

#### Trade off between security and ease of use
• Increased resource demands...
• Interferes with working patterns

#### Added Complexity
- Often users experience is placed at the fore-front of design
- usable design often not compatible with security
	- Windows XP vs Vista (green vs glass)

---
## Data Information
Security can be seen as controlling access to information
- hard, we usually control access to data
	- Data - a ***means to represent*** information
	- Information - an ***interpretation*** of the data 
- Focusing on data can still leave information available:
	- Bad: "Mike's criminal record cannot be found in the database"
		- implies Mike does not have a record
	- Bad: "You do not have permission to access Mike's criminal record"
		- implies mike does have a record
	- Good: "You do not have permission to make that request"
		- Does not imply anything
- Timing can infer information too

---
## Trade offs of computer security

#### Conflicting objectives
- Security vs. Usability
- Accountability vs. Privacy
- Availability vs. Authenticity
- Overhead (computation, computation, storage)

Compromises down to the threats and specific situation

---
## Security Focus
Computer Security is not rocket science if:
- approached in a systematic, disciplined and well planner manner
- approached from the inception / initial design of the system

But... adding as an after thought will ***often*** lead to disaster

#### Focus of Control
- Data - permitted manipulation of data
- Operations - permitted invocations
- Users - permissions for specific users / groups


---
## Complexity vs Assurance

*"Would we prefer a simple approach with high assurance? Or a feature-rich environment?"*

---
## Decentralised Controls

*"Should defining and enforcing security be performed by a central entity, or be left to individual components in a system?"*

#### Central Entity
A possible bottleneck and single point of failure

#### Distributed Solution
More efficient, but harder to manage


## Layered Security

Each layer protects a boundary, and relies on the security of the layer below
